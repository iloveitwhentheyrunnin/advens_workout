Hey there!

Here's a little workout I wanted to do just to get more into the Python language and build a web-application using Flask..
You can find the database file in the root of this repo just quickly import the database to test it!

Fast command to install required packages...
```
pip install Flask Flask-Assets Flask-Scss Flask-MySQLdb Flask-Bcrypt Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

Have fun!
